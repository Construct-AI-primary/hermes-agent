## Duplication Analysis

### Goals — No Overlap

| Company | Goals Summary |
|---------|---------------|
| DevForge AI | Enterprise development, orchestration, architecture, security, growth |
| DomainForge AI | Engineering expertise, quality standards, regulatory compliance |
| InfraForge AI | Infrastructure management, database solutions, mobile API |
| KnowledgeForge AI | Institutional memory, QA automation, discipline workflows |
| Loopy AI | Vision/image analysis |
| Org Template AI | Template for customisation |
| PromptForge AI | Prompt engineering, orchestration, ethical AI |
| QualityForge AI | Testing, debugging, quality assurance |

**Result**: No goal duplication. Each company has a distinct mission.

### Agents — No Duplicate Slugs

All agent slugs are unique and follow the pattern `{name}-{company}-{role}`. No agent slug appears in more than one company.

**Result**: No agent duplication.

### Skills — Some Overlap in Concept, Not Implementation

| Concept | Companies with similar skills | Notes |
|---------|------------------------------|-------|
| CEO/Leadership | All companies | Different CEO agents per company — expected |
| Code Review | DevForge (`reviewer-devforge-code-review-qa`), QualityForge (`reviewer-qualityforge-code-reviewer`) | Different scope — DevForge = general QA, QualityForge = specialised code review |
| Bug Fixing | DevForge (`fixer-devforge-bug-fixing`), QualityForge (`fixer-qualityforge-bug-fixing-specialist`) | Different scope — DevForge = general, QualityForge = specialist |
| Architecture | DevForge (`forge-devforge-system-architecture`), QualityForge (`architect-qualityforge-system-architect`) | Different scope — DevForge = building, QualityForge = reviewing |
| Strategic Planning | DevForge, DomainForge (`strategos-*`) | Different scope — DevForge = business strategy, DomainForge = engineering strategy |
| Quality Assurance | DomainForge, KnowledgeForge, QualityForge | Different scope — DomainForge = engineering QA, KnowledgeForge = cross-discipline QA, QualityForge = comprehensive QA |
| Weekly Review | DevForge, DomainForge, InfraForge, PromptForge, QualityForge, Org Template AI | **Expected** — recurring task pattern, not a skill duplication |
| Accessibility Testing | QualityForge (`accessibility-qualityforge-accessibility-testing`), Shared (`accessibility-standards`) | Shared skill is generic, QualityForge version is QA-specific |

**Result**: Conceptual overlap is expected and intentional. Each company's skills are scoped to their domain. The `shared/` folder correctly provides generic skills that any company can reference.

### Teams — Some Similar Names, Different Scope

| Team Name | Companies | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Engineering | DevForge, DomainForge, Org Template AI | DevForge = software engineering, DomainForge = civil/structural/geotechnical, Org = template placeholder |
| Operations | DomainForge, Org Template AI | DomainForge = procurement/logistics/finance, Org = template placeholder |
| Executive | DevForge, QualityForge | Expected — each company needs a leadership team |
| Governance | DomainForge | Only in DomainForge — governance/standards/legal |

**Result**: Team name overlap reflects standard org structure patterns, not duplication.

## Naming Convention

All companies follow this pattern:
- **Company**: `{name}-ai` (e.g., `devforge-ai`, `knowledgeforge-ai`)
- **Agent slug**: `{agent-name}-{company}-{role}` (e.g., `nexus-devforge-ceo`)
- **Skill slug**: `{skill-name}-{company}-{role}` (e.g., `nexus-devforge-ceo`)

## How to Add a New Company

1. Copy `org-template-ai/` as your starting point:
   ```bash
   cp -r docs-paperclip/companies/org-template-ai/ docs-paperclip/companies/my-company-ai/
   ```
2. Search/replace `org-template-ai` with your company slug
3. Customize `COMPANY.md`, agents, teams, skills, knowledge
4. See `companies-spec.md` for the full specification

## How to Add Shared Skills

Place generic skills in `shared/` that any company can reference:
```yaml
includes:
  - ../shared/accessibility-standards/SKILL.md
```

## Verification

```bash
# Validate a company package
paperclip companies validate docs-paperclip/companies/my-company-ai/

# Check for duplicate agent slugs
grep -r "^slug:" docs-paperclip/companies/*/agents/*/AGENTS.md | sort | uniq -d

# Check for duplicate skill slugs
grep -r "^name:" docs-paperclip/companies/*/skills/*/SKILL.md | sort | uniq -d
