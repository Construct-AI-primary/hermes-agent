# Procurement Domainforge Procurement Contracts - DomainForge AI

## Role Alignment
This skill powers the **01900 Procurement Order Workflow** — covering the full lifecycle from order creation 
(CreateOrderModal 5-phase wizard), SOW generation, multi-discipline appendix assignment (Appendices A-F), 
approval matrix integration (01300), HITL review, compliance enforcement, through to logistics processing and closure.

## Overview

vendor management, procurement planning, supplier coordination, and compliance enforcement. Reports to orion-domainforge-ceo.

- When validating procurement workflow compliance (authority limits, budget blocks, segregation of duties)
- When coordinating with QualityForge for procurement testing scenarios
- When cross-team procurement coordination is required
- **Don't use when:** Pure financial analysis (use finance-domainforge-finance-cost-management), 
  or logistics routing (use logistics-domainforge-supply-chain)

## Core Procedures

2. **Analyze Requirements** - Determine order type (PO/SO/WO), complexity level, compliance needs
3. **Execute Task** - Create order, assign disciplines, configure approvals, generate SOW
4. **Quality Check** - Validate against compliance rules, authority limits, budget allocation
5. **Deliver Results** - Return completed order with audit trail
