# PROC-003: Ensure Approval Matrix (01300) Integration

## Description

Verify and fix the integration between the 01900 procurement order creation and the 01300 Approval Matrix Management system. The CreateOrderModal should evaluate orders against approval matrices, configure approval workflows based on order value thresholds, and route for approval when required.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Approval matrix is loaded for organization and procurement type
- [ ] Order evaluation against approval matrix returns correct approval requirements
- [ ] Auto-approval thresholds work correctly (orders below threshold bypass approval)
- [ ] Multi-level approval chains are configured for orders above thresholds
- [ ] Approval workflow routing uses the existing 01300 system
- [ ] UI correctly displays approval status to the user
- [ ] Task notifications are sent to assigned approvers
