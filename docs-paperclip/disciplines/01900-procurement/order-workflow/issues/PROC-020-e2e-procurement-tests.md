# PROC-020: Execute Procurement E2E Tests

## Test Scenarios

From the procurement-testing skill:
- Scenario 1: Standard Order Creation (<$25k single approval)
- Scenario 2: High-Value Order with Multi-Level Approval (>$100k)
- Scenario 3: Rejection and Rework
- Scenario 4: Compliance Boundary Testing (no budget, over limit, self-approval)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All 4 test scenarios execute successfully
- [ ] No workflow step fails with unexpected errors
- [ ] Order status transitions are correct throughout
- [ ] Audit trail log is complete and accurate
- [ ] Test results documented with pass/fail for each step
