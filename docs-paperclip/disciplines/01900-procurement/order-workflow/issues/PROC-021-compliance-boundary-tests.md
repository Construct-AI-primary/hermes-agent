# PROC-021: Run Compliance Boundary Tests

## Description

Execute compliance boundary tests to verify that all procurement compliance rules are enforced correctly. This includes authority limits, budget blocks, segregation of duties, audit trail integrity, and document immutability.

## Test Scenarios

From the procurement-testing skill:
- Authority Limits: Order at threshold boundary → correct approver assigned
- Budget Limits: Order at 105% of budget → blocked with budget exceeded error
- Approval Sequence: Attempt parallel approval → sequential order enforced
- Audit Trail: Complete workflow → all actions logged, no gaps
- Immutability: Attempt to modify approved order → blocked or requires re-approval
- Segregation of Duties: User attempts to approve own order → routed to different approver
- Document Retention: Query historical records → records accessible, complete

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All 7 compliance rules tested and enforced
- [ ] Zero compliance bypasses found
- [ ] Authority limits trigger correct approval chains
- [ ] Budget hard blocks prevent over-spending
- [ ] Audit trail has no gaps for any workflow
- [ ] Approved orders cannot be modified without re-approval
