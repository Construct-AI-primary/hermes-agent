# PROC-022: Integration Tests (order→approval→budget→audit)

## Description

Execute integration tests to verify that system components integrate properly across the procurement workflow. This covers the full data flow between order creation, approval routing, budget allocation, and audit trail logging.

## Integration Points

- Order → Approval: Submit order for approval → approval chain triggered, approver notified
- Order → Budget: Create order with cost code → budget allocated, remaining balance updated
- PO → Invoice Reconciliation: Match invoice to PO → 3-way match result correct
- Contract → Order: Create order under contract → order terms match contract, pricing correct
- Supplier DB → Order: Select supplier for order → supplier on approved list, tier verified
- Audit Trail → All Actions: Execute workflow sequence → every action logged with actor, timestamp, data

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All 6 integration points pass testing
- [ ] Data flows correctly through the full order lifecycle
- [ ] No data loss at integration boundaries
- [ ] Error handling at integration points works correctly
- [ ] Integration test results documented
