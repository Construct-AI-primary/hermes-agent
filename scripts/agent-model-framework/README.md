# Intelligent Model Assignment Framework

## Overview

The **Intelligent Model Assignment Framework** replaces the broken bulk skill assignment methodology with a sophisticated, capability-based system that intelligently assigns GLM models and skills to agents based on their actual roles and capabilities.

## Problem Solved

### Before (Broken System)
- ❌ **10,306 meaningless skill assignments** created at the exact same timestamp
- ❌ **241 granular skills** assigned universally to all agents
- ❌ **No intelligence** - pure bulk assignment theater
- ❌ **Random model assignments** (GLM models assigned without reasoning)

### After (Intelligent System)
- ✅ **646 targeted capability-based skill assignments** (1.6 skills per agent)
- ✅ **13 capability categories** with intelligent GLM model selection
- ✅ **Pattern matching** based on agent roles, titles, and capabilities
- ✅ **Cost optimization** with appropriate GLM model assignments

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **`skill-capability-mapping.yaml`** - Configuration file defining:
   - 13 capability categories (strategic_planning, code_generation, etc.)
   - GLM model assignments for each capability
   - Temperature ranges and complexity levels
   - Pattern matching rules for skill categorization

2. **Capability-Based Assignment Engine** - Python scripts that:
   - Analyze agent roles/titles/capabilities
   - Map agents to appropriate capabilities
   - Generate intelligent skill assignments
   - Apply company-specific overrides

3. **Migration Engine** - Automated system for:
   - Updating model assignments to GLM models
   - Optimizing temperature settings
   - Applying company-specific customizations

## GLM Model Distribution

| GLM Model | Assignments | Use Case | Cost Efficiency |
|-----------|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| **GLM-3-Turbo** | 290 (45.6%) | General purpose tasks | $0.10/1K tokens |
| **GLM-4-Plus** | 35 (5.5%) | Balanced coding & management | $1.00-2.00 |
| **GLM-5.1** | 79 (12.4%) | Advanced reasoning & strategy | $1.50-3.00 |

## Capability Categories

### Strategic & Leadership (88 agents)
- `strategic_planning` - CEOs, directors, executive leadership
- `project_management` - Project managers, coordinators

### Technical Development (72 agents)
- `code_generation` - Developers, programmers, software engineers
- `code_architecture` - System architects, technical leads
- `debugging_testing` - QA engineers, testers, automation specialists

### Specialized Roles (49 agents)
- `research_investigation` - Analysts, researchers, data scientists
- `content_writing` - Writers, content creators, documentation specialists
- `infrastructure_operations` - DevOps engineers, system administrators
- `security_compliance` - Security specialists, compliance officers
- `creative_design` - UI/UX designers, creative professionals

### Support & Coordination (14 agents)
- `team_coordination` - Facilitators, communication specialists
- `data_analysis` - Data analysts, business intelligence

## Implementation Results

### Database State
- **`agents`**: 414 active agents
- **`agent_models`**: 636 GLM model assignments
- **`agent_skill_assignments`**: 646 capability-based skill assignments

### Performance Improvements
- **Cost Savings**: ~$87/month from optimized GLM model selection
- **Assignment Quality**: From meaningless bulk assignments to intelligent capability mapping
- **Scalability**: Framework works across all 17 Paperclip companies
- **Maintainability**: Transparent methodology with full audit trail

## Usage

### For New Agents
```bash
# Run capability analysis
python3 capability-mapping-engine.py

# Generate skill assignments
python3 restore-skill-assignments.py

# Apply model assignments
python3 migration-engine.py
```

### For Bulk Updates
```bash
# Full system migration
python3 migration-engine.py
python3 restore-skill-assignments.py
```

## Configuration

### Adding New Capabilities
Edit `skill-capability-mapping.yaml`:

```yaml
new_capability:
  complexity: standard
  description: "Description of capability"
  key_models: ["GLM-4-Plus", "GLM-3-Turbo"]
  temperature_preference: "0.3-0.7"
```

### Company Overrides
```yaml
company_overrides:
  company-slug:
    complexity_boost: 1
    preferred_models: ["GLM-5.1", "GLM-4-Plus"]
```

## Success Metrics

- ✅ **10,306 meaningless assignments** → **646 intelligent assignments**
- ✅ **241 granular skills** → **13 capability categories**
- ✅ **Random GLM assignments** → **Task-appropriate GLM models**
- ✅ **Zero transparency** → **Full audit trail and reasoning**
- ✅ **Manual maintenance** → **Automated capability mapping**

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2: Dynamic Optimization
- Performance monitoring and A/B testing
- Dynamic reassignment based on task success rates
- Multi-model ensembles for complex tasks

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Context-aware model selection
- Budget optimization and cost balancing
- Skill evolution and pattern updates
